                <h2>Inherited, Given and Taught</h2>
                <p>Mothers give their daughters many things, perhaps the most important of which is life itself. Even beyond this, most mothers and daughters share an undeniable connection, ever-changing and ever-evolving as each grow and  progress through time. Mothers pass many things on to their daughters — from family heirlooms in some cases to quirks or characteristsics in others, some things stay constant through generations of women.</p> <p>For Mia Horne, that trait is extreme, consistent, and borderline laughable tardiness. </p>
                <p>"She's constantly late to everything. Not just five or ten minutes late, like 30 minutes to an hour late," Horne said of her mother Jennifer. "I would get so mad at her. I'd be late to violin lessons, I'd be late to violin recitals, anything. And I always vowed I would never do the same thing." 
                </p>
                <p>But try as she did, Horne was not able to escape her lineage — she now totes her mother's legacy of lateness everywhere she goes in the same uncanny way.</p>

                <h4>"My favorite thing about my mom that she is a crazy good public speaker. I'm constantly impressed by the way she's able to carry herself." - Mia Horne</h4>
                <p></p>
                 <p>Luckily, a poor sense of time wasn't all Horne received from her time under her mother's wing. Even at a young age, Horne watched her mother endure incredible hardships and was savvy enough to realize the toll it was taking. Horne's mother was putting herself through law school as the single parent of two young children all while enduring a divorce and constant financial strife. </p>
                <p>But Horne maintains that it never slowed her down.</p>
                <p>"She's really, really driven. And she has a really high standards for me," Horne said. "I also think it's pushed me in ways that I wouldn't be able to push myself."</p>

                <p>Edye Udell is usually nothing short of the smartest in the room — a graduate of both MIT and Cal Tech, her incredible intelligence was passed on to her daughter, Sammy, who now attends UC Berkeley as a math major. </p>
                <p>But the first thing  that comes to mind when Chean-Udell thinks of what she inherited from her mother? A strong love of strong tea.</p>
                <p>"She gave me a hot water heater when I moved to Berkeley for college and she wanted to make sure I'd always be able to have it wherever I want, which I think is funny," Chean-Udell said.</p>
                <p>Likewise, Chean-Udell feels that every quirk she inhereted from her mother is far outweighed by the sense of value she instilled in her. She attended an all-girls school that her mother now teaches chemistry at and was taught to never be afraid of inhabiting spaces traditionally designed to exclude women.</p>
                <p>"She, as a high school teacher, saw how women are treated, and she wanted to make sure that I physically didn't know about that until I had to know about it. "</p>

                <p></p>
                <p>Chean-Udell believes her strong sense of self was a product of having her mother consistently encourage her to push her limits. Because no matter what, at the end of the day, they will alwyas have each other to share a mug of tea with. </p>

                <p>As for me, I share a same appreciaion for the woman who raised me. My mother Stephanie is without a doubt my closest companion, and I am lucky enough to be able to turn to her no matter what tempest I'm weathering. She is empathetic and caring yet equally strong and defensive, and there is no one who I feel is a better representation of love to me.</p>
                <img class="d-block img-fluid mb-5 mt-5" src="https://media.journalism.berkeley.edu/upload/2020/08/15971123805242ef4.jpg" alt="Stephanie in restaurant"> 
                <p>She is equally close with her own mother, and the three of us share a bond that is emblematic of friendship incarnate. The three of us are eerily similar in everything from our short statures to our noses, not to mention the many emotional traits that unite us all.  </p>
                <p>These women have surrounded me with love my entire life, and having inherited not only their wisdom but their determination makes me feel as if I am carrying on their legacy with me everyday. Though distance keeps us apart while I'm at college, it takes only a phonecall for me to feel like I'm right back home — and one thing my mother inherited from hers was the tried and true Southern talent of being able to talk for a long, long time.</p>
